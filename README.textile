h1. Argonaut is a lightweight JSON builder template handler for Rails

h2. Usage

It's a whole lot like .xml.builder, only it's .json.argonaut.  Make an appropriately named view, like @show.json.argonaut@ and put something in it like:

<pre><code>
doc.list do |list|
  list.created_at @list.created_at
  list.items do |items|
    for item in @list.items
      items.item do |item_node|
        item_node.title item.title
      end
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

And you'll get back some nice JSON.  All of the actual heavy lifting is handled by the json gem.  We're really just building up a big hash with the builder pattern.
