h1. Argonaut is a lightweight JSON builder template handler for Rails

h2. Installing it

It's as easy as:
<pre><code>script/plugin install git://github.com/jbr/argonaut.git
</code></pre>

h2. Usage

It's a whole lot like .xml.builder, only it's .json.argonaut.  Make an appropriately named view, like @show.json.argonaut@ and put something in it like:

<pre><code>for idea in @ideas
  doc.ideas do |i|
    i.title idea.title
    for comment in idea.comments
      i.comments do |c|
        c.author comment.author.to_s
        c.text comment.text
      end
    end
  end
end

</code></pre>

Which is identical to

<pre><code>{
  :ideas => @ideas.map do |idea|
    {
      :title => idea.title,
      :comments => idea.comments.map do |comment|
        {
          :author => comment.author.to_s,
          :text => comment.text
        }
      end
    }
  end
}.to_json
end
</code></pre>

Just a little code kata, not really sure that the former is actually prettier.
